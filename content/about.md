## Professional Interests

I have a particular interest in helping develop software for science and engineering, but generally enjoy working on
things that are hard and that bridge disciplines. Prior experience ranges from Formula One cars to quantitative
financial analytics systems.

The work that I find most exciting tends to fall into a few categories:

- Scientific computing—data analysis, simulation development, signal processing, optimisation.
- Back-end web development—system design and architecture, database design and development, API development.
- DevOps—CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, orchestration, automation, monitoring and observability, etc.

I also have a fairly long-standing interest in the more operational aspects of technical work; the systems, processes,
and cultures that shape how work is organised, approached, and executed, and how information is shared.

### Employment History

There's a detailed job history on [_the soul crushing website_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-mccleery/) and given in
my [CV](/cv), but I've had the pleasure of working on some very cool projects with some very sharp people.

The short version is:

  Engineer, Intern
- 2014 - 2016: [Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains](https://www.mercedes-amg-hpp.com/), Mechanical Engineer,
  Graduate
- 2016 - 2017: [Force India/Racing Point F1](https://www.astonmartinf1.com/)<sup>†</sup>: Junior Strategy & Performance
  Engineer
- 2017 - 2019: [Force India/Racing Point F1](https://www.astonmartinf1.com/)<sup>†</sup>: Vehicle Science Engineer
- 2019 - 2019: [B-Secur](https://www.b-secur.com/), Senior Algorithm Engineer
- 2019 - 2021: [Quant Insight](https://quant-insight.com/), Lead Developer / Back-End Engineer

- 2025 - Present: [Zoo](https://www.zoo.dev/), Staff Engineer in Residence

<sup>†</sup>_Now [Aston Martin F1](https://www.astonmartinf1.com/)_

I have also worked on a number of projects in a consulting capacity, including continuing to work with
[Quant Insight](https://quant-insight.com/) for some time after leaving my full-time role, and working on the
development and deployment of defence-focused LLM systems with a related organisation.

### Academics

I studied Mechanical Engineering at [QUB](https://www.qub.ac.uk/). I received a first class honours degree, and was
awarded an [Institution of Mechanical Engineers](https://www.imeche.org/) prize for work on battery management systems.

## Personal Interests

### Motorsport

Cars and bikes are very close to my heart, especially small displacement two strokes.

I've had a copy of A. Graham Bell's
[Two Stroke Performance Tuning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Stroke-Performance-Tuning-Graham-Bell/dp/1859606199) since
I was about 12 or 13, and followed just about every form of motorsport at some point or other—though I'm really more
attracted to the notion of a well resourced, highly competitive engineering contest than I am to motorsport as an
example of what we normally mean by 'sport'.

In the late 2000s, I did an incredibly average job on the Irish club racing circuit. Though relatively quick in the wet,
I eventually realised I was going to be more use doing sums than I was dragging elbows.

For someone who owns a light up mechanical keyboard, I'm also relatively practical, having built and maintained bikes
and cars since I was a teenager, and since discovered that working with wood is good fun.

### Music

I love electronic music. Largely unguided fiddling with synthesizers and drum machines gave rise to my interest in
signal processing, and that experience was incredibly helpful in more than one actual job I've had.

One track of mine has been pressed by [Fundamental](https://fundamentalrecords.bandcamp.com/merch), but it's been a long
time since I fired up Ableton or twiddled a filter.

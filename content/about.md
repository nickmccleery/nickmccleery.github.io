Engineer who likes working at the intersection of hardware and software.

## Professional Interests

I like working on things that are hard and that bridge disciplines.

The work I enjoy most is probably best described as 'data-driven engineering'—to half pinch the title of
[Steven Brunton's](https://twitter.com/eigensteve) book,
[Data Driven Science and Engineering](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/datadriven-science-and-engineering/77D52B171B60A496EAFE4DB662ADC36E).

This typically means combining mechanical engineering with software development and/or data analysis and reporting, and
has largely been in the context of F1 vehicle dynamics and powertrain development, but I've also had great experiences
building DSP and financial modelling tech.

I like thermofluids, dynamics, optimisation, control, data visualisation—that sort of thing. I also enjoy things like
cloud architecture and database design, and get fairly worked up about how work is approached, how problems are tackled,
how information is shared etc.

### Employment History

There's a detailed job history on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-mccleery/), but I've had the pleasure
of working on some very cool projects with some very sharp people.

### Academic Stuff

I studied Mechanical Engineering at [QUB](https://www.qub.ac.uk/). I received a first class honours degree, and was
awarded an [Institution of Mechanical Engineers](https://www.imeche.org/) prize for work on battery management systems.

You can read the associated report [here](/2014-NMcCleery-BMSProtocol.pdf). Contains the word 'batter' instead of
'battery' many times.

## Personal Interests

### Motorsport

Cars and bikes are very close to my heart, especially small displacement two strokes.

At the risk of sounding like a sad bastard, I've had a copy of A. Graham Bell's
[Two Stroke Performance Tuning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Stroke-Performance-Tuning-Graham-Bell/dp/1859606199) since
I was about 12 or 13, and followed just about every form of motorsport at some point or other—though I'm really more
attracted to the notion of a well resourced, highly competitive engineering contest than I am to motorsport as an
example what we normally mean by 'sport'.

In the late 2000s, I did an incredibly average job on the Irish club racing circuit, almost invariably finishing 6th.
Though relatively quick in the wet, I eventually realised I was going to be more use doing sums than I was dragging
elbows.

For someone who owns a light up mechanical keyboard, I'm also relatively practical, having built and maintained bikes
and cars since I was a teenager, and since discovered that working with wood is good fun.

### Music

I'm a big fan of electronic music. Largely unguided fiddling with synthesizers and drum machines gave rise to my
interest in signal processing, and that experience was incredibly helpful in more than one actual job I've had.

One track of mine has been pressed by [Fundamental](https://fundamentalrecords.bandcamp.com/merch), but it's been a long
time since I fired up Ableton or twiddled a filter.
